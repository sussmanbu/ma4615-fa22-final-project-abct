## Data Description: 

The main dataset used within this project can be found at https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/school_scores/.

We focused on a data set from the CORGIS Dataset Project that presents students’ academic scoring along with family income, GPA, and gender. his data set comes from the CORGIS Datasets Project and has 578 rows and 99 columns. The data reports SAT scores from the Common Core of Data (CCD), which is the Department of Education’s primary comprehensive database on public primary and secondary education data. The Department of Education collects data on students in hopes of using analysis results to assess teacher performance and improve classroom experiences. 

The data was collected by Austin Cory Bart, and he can be reached at acbart@vt.edu. He worked alongside Dennis Kafura, Clifford A. Shaffer, Javier Tibau, Luke Gusukuma, and Eli Tilevich.

## Cleaned Data File:

Our [load_and_clean_data.R](/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how we loaded and cleaned our data. You can find it attached within the code below.

```{r cleaned data}

cleandatafile <- here::here("static", "load_and_clean_data.R")

```

## Organizing our Data:

In order to better organize the dataset, we changed the column names to more readable titles. 
These titles include: year, state code, state name, average gpa per subject, average years per subject, income levels, gender, and SAT Scores. 
Subjects include: Arts/Music, English, 'Foreign Languages, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences/History.
Income levels per year include: less than 20k, 20 to 40k, 40 to 60k, 60 to 80k, 80 to 100k, more than 100k.
Moreover, we mutated the total score column to combine the math score and the verbal scores. We also mutated the income columns to do the same thing.

```{r, message=FALSE}

schooldata <- school_scores_data_clean %>% mutate(total.score = total.math + total.verbal) %>% 
  mutate(income.between.20.40k = income.between.20.40k.math + income.between.20.40k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.between.40.60k = income.between.40.60k.math + income.between.40.60k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.between.60.80k = income.between.60.80k.math + income.between.60.80k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.between.80.100k = income.between.80.100k.math + income.between.80.100k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.less.than.20k = income.less.than.20k.math + income.less.than.20k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.more.than.100k = income.more.than.100k.math + income.more.than.100k.verbal)
  
```

To save some time and space, we loaded all changes from the chunk above into a new csv file, titled "schooldataclean.csv"
We did this by using the write_csv function in the console. 

Next, we decided to use pivot_longer on the income brackets so that we could create a singular, comprehensive income bracket column to use in our analysis later.

## Pivoted Data:

```{r pivot_longer on schooldatacleaned}
schooldatacleaned <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/schooldatacleaned.csv"))
schooldatacleaned_math <- schooldatacleaned %>% 
  select(year,"state.code","state.name","income.less.than.20k.math", "income.between.20.40k.math", "income.between.40.60k.math", "income.between.60.80k.math", "income.between.80.100k.math", "income.more.than.100k.math") %>%
  pivot_longer(c(income.less.than.20k.math, income.between.20.40k.math, income.between.40.60k.math, income.between.60.80k.math, income.between.80.100k.math, income.more.than.100k.math), 
               names_to = "income.bracket.math", 
               values_to = "average.math.score.of.bracket", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(income.bracket = str_remove(income.bracket.math, ".math")) %>%
  select("state.code", "state.name", "income.bracket","average.math.score.of.bracket") 
schooldatacleaned_math

schooldatacleaned_verbal <- schooldatacleaned %>% 
  select(year,"state.code","state.name", "income.less.than.20k.verbal", "income.between.20.40k.verbal", "income.between.40.60k.verbal", "income.between.60.80k.verbal", "income.between.80.100k.verbal", "income.more.than.100k.verbal") %>%
  pivot_longer(c(income.less.than.20k.verbal, income.between.20.40k.verbal, income.between.40.60k.verbal, income.between.60.80k.verbal, income.between.80.100k.verbal, income.more.than.100k.verbal), 
               names_to = "income.bracket.verbal", 
               values_to = "average.verbal.score.of.bracket", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(income.bracket = str_remove(income.bracket.verbal, ".verbal")) %>%
  select("state.code", "state.name", "income.bracket", "average.verbal.score.of.bracket")

schooldatacleaned_math$average.verbal.score.of.bracket <- schooldatacleaned_verbal$average.verbal.score.of.bracket
incomescore <- schooldatacleaned_math %>% 
  bind_cols(schooldatacleaned_verbal$average.verbal.score.of.bracket) %>%
  select("state.code", "income.bracket", "average.math.score.of.bracket", "average.verbal.score.of.bracket")
incomescore
```
We then loaded this into a new csv file as well, titled "schooldatacleaned_pivoted.csv"

The most important columns in this dataset are listed below:

* state.code: the abbreviation for the state the observation is pulled from
* income.bracket: the bracket from which the observation is pulled from
* average.math.score.of.bracket: the average math score of the particular income bracket in the particular state
* average.verbal.score.of.bracket: the average verbal score of the particular income bracket in the particular state

## Filtered Gender Data:

Next, we filtered the dataset to only look at the scores between females and males.
```{r}
schooldatacleaned <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/schooldatacleaned.csv"))
genderscore <- schooldatacleaned %>% 
  select(year,"state.code","state.name", "gender.female.math", "gender.female.verbal", "gender.male.math", "gender.male.verbal") %>%
  mutate(female.total.score = gender.female.math + gender.female.verbal) %>%
  mutate(male.total.score = gender.male.math + gender.male.verbal) %>%
  select("year", "state.code", "state.name", "gender.female.math","gender.female.verbal", "female.total.score","gender.male.math", "gender.male.verbal", "male.total.score") 
genderscore
```

This was then loaded into a new csv file as well, titled "genderscore.csv"

## Census Data:

Additionally, We decided to include information from the US Census demographic data from 2017 that we found on Kaggle. 
This dataset contains demographic data of the U.S. population from 2017, with 37 columns and 74000 rows. By combining this dataset with our schools scores data, we can use this information to find other factors that might contribute to deviations in SAT scores, e.g. gender ratios, racial demographics.

First, we loaded and cleaned the data using the file:
`[load_and_clean_data.R](/load_and_clean_data.R)`

One comparison to note is that the State.Name column in the original dataset is equal to the State column in the new dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
census_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/acs2017_census_tract_data.csv"))

censusdata <- census_data %>% mutate(State.Name = State) %>% ungroup() %>%
  select(State.Name, White, Black, Asian, Native, Pacific)

newdata_1 <- school_scores_data_clean %>% mutate(total.score = total.math + total.verbal) %>% 
  mutate(income.between.20.40k = income.between.20.40k.math + income.between.20.40k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.between.40.60k = income.between.40.60k.math + income.between.40.60k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.between.60.80k = income.between.60.80k.math + income.between.60.80k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.between.80.100k = income.between.80.100k.math + income.between.80.100k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.less.than.20k = income.less.than.20k.math + income.less.than.20k.verbal) %>%
  mutate(income.more.than.100k = income.more.than.100k.math + income.more.than.100k.verbal) %>%
  ungroup()

incomedata <- newdata_1 %>% select(state.name, total.score, income.between.20.40k, income.between.40.60k,
                                   income.between.60.80k, income.between.80.100k, income.less.than.20k,
                                   income.more.than.100k)


newdata_inc <- incomedata %>% left_join(censusdata,
                                        by = c("state.name" = "State.Name"))
newdata_inc
```

This dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data contains demographic data of the U.S. population from 2017 with 37 columns and 740000 rows total. We chose this dataset to combine with our original one because we want to see if we can find other factors that could contribute to or explain the differences in SAT scores between states and different income levels — for example, certain states may have racial and gender demographics that historically perform more poorly on standardized tests. 

The data here was collected by the US Census Bureau. As a product of the US federal government, this is not subject to copyright within the US.

## Summary: 

In summary, the primary datasets we will be using for our analysis are:

* school_scores_data_clean.csv
* incomescore.csv
* genderscore.csv
* newdata_inc.csv
