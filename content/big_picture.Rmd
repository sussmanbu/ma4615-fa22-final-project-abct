### High SAT Score or High Tax Bracket? Probably Both, According to Experts

Welcome! Our project site aims to provide some insight into how and why family income, rather than raw intelligence, may be the better predictor of SAT scores, and conversely, how SAT scores may be a better predictor of a studentâ€™s family income rather than intelligence. As the saying goes, meritocracy entrenches inequality; standardized tests like the SAT were allegedly designed to even the playing field for all students applying for top colleges, but the multimillion-dollar test prep industry seems to give families with higher incomes a significant advantage in preparing their children to perform well on the exam. According to Jerome Karabel, the author of The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, states that 

 > the children of the working class and the poor are about as unlikely to attend the Big Three [Harvard, Yale, and Princeton] today as they were in 1954.

As you explore our website, you will see that through various modeling and inference techniques performed in RStudio, we found a number of significant relationships between family income and SAT scores in the United States. On this page, you can see some of our most basic and significant findings.
