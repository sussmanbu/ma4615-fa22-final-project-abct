## High SAT Score or High Tax Bracket? Probably Both, According to Experts

Welcome! Our project site aims to provide some insight into how and why family income, rather than raw intelligence, may be the better predictor of SAT scores, and conversely, how SAT scores may be a better predictor of a studentâ€™s family income rather than intelligence. As the saying goes, meritocracy entrenches inequality; standardized tests like the SAT were allegedly designed to even the playing field for all students applying for top colleges, but the multi-million dollar test prep industry seems to give families with higher incomes a significant advantage in preparing their children to perform well on the exam. According to Jerome Karabel, the author of The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, states that 

 > the children of the working class and the poor are about as unlikely to attend the Big Three [Harvard, Yale, and Princeton] today as they were in 1954.

As you explore our website, you will see that through various modeling and inference techniques performed in RStudio, we found a number of significant relationships between family income and SAT scores in the United States. On this page, you can see some of our most basic and significant findings.

## Journey: 
### Questions to Explore:

Some questions we would like to answer are:

1. What is the nature of the relationship between family income and SAT scores?
2. Is this relationship statistically significant?
3. Are there differences in income and SAT scores between states? 
4. Are other factors, like gender, better predictors of SAT scores?
5. Do any of these relationships change over time?

### Map of Average Total Score by State

To provide a quick overview of the dataset we are working with, we created a grid of SAT scores by regions and created a heat map of the United States below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# map of average total score by state
library(tmap)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

schooldata <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/school_scores_data_clean.csv"))

schooldata4 <- schooldata %>%
  mutate(Total.Score = Total.Math + Total.Verbal) %>%
  select("State.Name", "Total.Score") %>%
  group_by(State.Name) %>%
  transmute(avg.total.score = mean(Total.Score), State.Name)
schooldata4 <- unique(schooldata4)
schooldata4 <- schooldata4 %>% transmute(NAME = State.Name, avg.total.score)

state_data <- st_read(here::here("dataset/state_data/state_data.shp"))

schooldata_tm <- inner_join(state_data, schooldata4, by =
                              "NAME")

tm_shape(schooldata_tm) + tm_polygons(col = "avg.total.score", title = "Avg SAT Score") + tm_layout(title = "Average SAT Score by State", title.position = c("center", "top"))

```

We see here that the highest average SAT scores are clustered in the Midwest. This may be surprising to many, since the Northeast region, particularly New England, is thought of as the most intelligent part of the United States. We explore the reasons behind this phenomenon on the analysis page, but to sum it up, since many kids in the Midwest do not plan on going to college, the SAT is only taken by the minority who are looking to attend institutions of higher education, leading to higher average SAT scores across the region. Our map here also does not show the average SAT scores of non-US-continental territories, and our analysis page discusses those scores and the reasons behind them. 

## Average SAT Score of Lowest and Highest Income Brackets

Now, we look at the overarching question of our entire project: is income a good predictor of SAT scores? Before getting into the nitty-gritty of every income bracket, we decided to single out just the lowest and highest brackets and look at their average SAT scores among six states: three with the highest median household incomes, and three with the lowest. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
schooldata <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/school_scores_data_clean.csv"))
sixstates <- c("MD", "NJ", "MA", "AR", "WV", "MS")
incomerange <- c("income.less.than.20k", "income.more.than.100k")

incomescore <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/incomescore.csv"))
incomescore <- incomescore %>% 
  filter(state.code %in% sixstates) %>%
  filter(income.bracket %in% incomerange) %>%
  mutate(average.total.score.of.bracket = average.math.score.of.bracket + average.verbal.score.of.bracket) %>% 
  select("state.code", "income.bracket", "average.total.score.of.bracket") 

incomescore6 <- incomescore %>%
  filter(state.code %in% sixstates) %>%
  select("state.code", "income.bracket", "average.total.score.of.bracket") %>%
  group_by(income.bracket, state.code) %>%
  summarise(average.total.score.of.bracket = mean(average.total.score.of.bracket))
incomescore6

ggplot(data = incomescore6, mapping = aes(x = state.code, y = average.total.score.of.bracket, fill = income.bracket)) + geom_col() + labs(x = "State", y = "Average SAT Score", fill = "Income Bracket", title = "Average SAT Score of Lowest and Highest Income Brackets") + facet_wrap(~income.bracket) 
```

The figure above shows a significant difference in SAT scores between the two income brackets for all six states; on average, across these six states, scores increase by 24% between these two income brackets. This means that students coming from families making more than 100,000 dollars a year have scores nearly 400 points higher than their counterparts coming from families making less than 20,000 dollars a year. This supports our working hypothesis that higher family incomes lead to higher SAT scores, and we discuss the factors behind such a relationship in more depth on our analysis page. 

## Average SAT Score by Gender and State

We knew that although the figure above supports our hypothesis that higher incomes lead to higher SAT scores, there are likely other factors that can be good predictors of SAT scores as well, so we created a similar graphic below, comparing average SAT scores across the same six states by gender rather than income bracket. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
genderscore <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/genderscore.csv"))

genderscore_pivoted <- genderscore %>%
  filter(state.code %in% sixstates) %>%
  select("state.code", "female.total.score", "male.total.score") %>%
  pivot_longer(c(female.total.score, male.total.score),
               names_to = "total.score", 
               values_to = "score",
               ) %>%
  mutate(gender = str_remove(total.score, ".total.score")) %>%
  group_by(gender, state.code) %>%
  summarise(gender.score = mean(score)) %>%
  select(state.code, gender, gender.score)

ggplot(data = genderscore_pivoted, mapping = aes(x = state.code, y = gender.score, fill = gender)) + geom_col() + labs(x = "State", y = "Average SAT Score", fill = "Gender", title = "Average SAT Score by Gender and State") + facet_wrap(~gender) 

```

Though there is still a difference between the two genders' average SAT scores, it is not quite as significant as the disparity between the lowest and highest income brackets; here, males tend to have scores 4% higher than their female counterparts. While the difference here is not as large as that for income, it is still notable that gender was found to have an effect on SAT score, which we further discuss in the analysis page. 

The dashboard below is an interactive figure that we hope our visitors find enjoyable and informative. For any more questions, please feel free to contact us from our [github pages](https://abctma415f22.netlify.app/about/).

## Interactive:

To get started using this interactive, you can find instructions on how to use it [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPklnf4x3KzSFGAmso8MMI7WPcWwKVKCUuUhl1MxNDzjjSPCwk5nHDcShPNnOKWIQ?key=ZVJnMW5NYnNEbW9KRFpSYXRLREZkREVHUnV4cW9n).

[Income and Gender Scores based on State](https://avramoutar.shinyapps.io/incomegenderinteractive/)

Within this interactive, these graphs help us further prove the conclusions from our analysis and big picture pages.

This tool is designed by ShinyApp. It shows the variation of SAT scores across states, based on gender and income brackets by looking at two scatter-plots. In these side by side scatter-plots, one can assess the effect of gender, income bracket, or both factors on SAT scores to see if there is any difference in scores between male and female students and their family income. 

 > What is the nature of the relationship between family income and SAT scores?

When the income.less.than.20k bracket and the income.more.than.100k bracket are plotted together together, you can see that the nature of the relationship between family income and SAT scores is that the higher the family income, the higher the SAT scores across the United States. 

 > Are there differences in income and SAT scores between states? 
 
When plotting the average total.score within the gender graph, you can see that the Midwest indisputably has the highest SAT scores overall. 

 > Are other factors, like gender, better predictors of SAT scores?
 
When female.total.score is plotted alongside male.total.score, you can see that male scores are definitively higher than female scores. Additionally, even the average total scores are higher than the average female total scores across states. 

### Conclusion & Discussion:
This interactive tool strongly supports our conclusion in our analysis and big picture:

* Generally, income bracket and SAT score have a statistically significant relationship; as income increases, so does SAT score
* However, gender can also be a valuable predictor for SAT score
* Collegeboard should revisit their exam to reduce the things that contribute to differences in scores among income brackets and genders; alternatively, colleges can put less emphasis on SAT scores as a measure of a student's intelligence and potential.
