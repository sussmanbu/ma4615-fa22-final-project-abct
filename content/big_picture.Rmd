## High SAT Score or High Tax Bracket? Probably Both, According to Experts

Welcome! Our project site aims to provide some insight into how and why family income, rather than raw intelligence, may be the better predictor of SAT scores, and conversely, how SAT scores may be a better predictor of a studentâ€™s family income rather than intelligence. As the saying goes, meritocracy entrenches inequality; standardized tests like the SAT were allegedly designed to even the playing field for all students applying for top colleges, but the multimillion-dollar test prep industry seems to give families with higher incomes a significant advantage in preparing their children to perform well on the exam. According to Jerome Karabel, the author of The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, states that 

 > the children of the working class and the poor are about as unlikely to attend the Big Three [Harvard, Yale, and Princeton] today as they were in 1954.

As you explore our website, you will see that through various modeling and inference techniques performed in RStudio, we found a number of significant relationships between family income and SAT scores in the United States. On this page, you can see some of our most basic and significant findings.

The dashboard below is an interactive graph that we hope our visitors find enjoyable and informative. For any more questions, please feel free to contact us at:

## Interactive:

[Income and Gender Scores based on State](http://127.0.0.1:5418)

Within this interactive, these graphs help us further prove the conclusions from our analysis and big picture pages. This tool is designed by ShinyApp. It shows the variation of SAT scores across states, based on gender and income brackets by looking at two scatter-plots. In these side by side scatter-plots, one can assess the effect of gender, income bracket, or both factors on SAT scores to see if there is any difference in scores between male and female students and their family income. 

### Conclusion & Discussion:
This interactive tool strongly supports our conclusion in our analysis and big picture:

* point 1
* point 2
