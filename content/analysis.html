<h2>Data Description:</h2>
<p>The variables we are most interested in are total math and verbal SAT scores as well as family income — namely, we want to examine whether or not there exists a statistically significant relationship between family income and SAT scores, and the form of these relationships (i.e., linear, logistic, etc.). Over the past several years, more and more questions have arose regarding whether or not colleges (and the rest of the world) should be looking at SAT scores as a credible measure of aptitude and intelligence, or if they are simply another tool for the privileged to remain at the top.</p>

<h2>Important Questions:</h2>
<p>Some questions we would like to answer are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the nature of the relationship between family income and SAT scores?</li>
<li>Is this relationship statistically significant?</li>
<li>Are there differences in income and SAT scores between states?</li>
<li>Is GPA more affected by family income than SAT scores?</li>
<li>Are other factors, like gender and year, better predictors of SAT scores?</li>
<li>Do any of these relationships change over time?</li>

<h3>Figure 1: Six States Comparison</h3>
<p>We began our exploratory data analysis by examining the average SAT score across six different states: the three states with the highest median household incomes, and the three states with the lowest median household incomes.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 2
## # Groups:   State.Code [6]
##   State.Code avg.total.score
##   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 AR                   1139.
## 2 MA                   1042.
## 3 MD                   1002 
## 4 MS                   1123.
## 5 NJ                   1014.
## 6 WV                   1018</code></pre>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/figure%201-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see that this plot does not support our conjecture that higher family incomes lead to higher SAT scores, as the scores for Arkansas and Mississippi, two of the states with the lowest median household income in the country, have higher average SAT scores than all three states with the highest median household incomes. We then wanted to see if any states in particular had higher SAT scores, so we decided to create some figures that examine all 50 states as well as D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>

<h3>Figure 2: All States and their Average SAT Scores</h3>
<p>To further see if there are significant differences in SAT scores across states, we decided to make a plot with boxplots of all states.</p>

Here we can see that across all U.S. territories there are notable differences in median SAT scores between them. This plot shows Iowa with the highest median SAT score, which could be explained by the fact that the Midwest dominates the SAT according to a Forbes article. This will be further discussed in our next figure, as we opted to look at the SAT scores across different regions of the continental U.S.</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-3-breakdown-of-average-sat-scores-by-region" class="section level3">
<h3>Figure 3: Breakdown of Average SAT Scores by Region</h3>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/figure%203-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From both figures we see that the Midwest indisputably has the highest SAT scores overall. This seemed odd to us, so we did a bit of research and found that it has been a repeating pattern for students in the Midwest to dominate the exam. As it turns out, from a Forbes article (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bentaylor/2014/07/17/why-the-midwest-dominates-the-sat/?sh=15c87cf72f37" class="uri">https://www.forbes.com/sites/bentaylor/2014/07/17/why-the-midwest-dominates-the-sat/?sh=15c87cf72f37</a>), we learned that most students in the Midwest opt to not take any standardized college entrance exams, and if they do, most choose to only take the ACT. Thus, the majority of the students taking the SAT in the Midwest are the very “best” students; that is, students who want to attend the most presitigious colleges, most of whose applications require an SAT score, so the overall scores are higher.</p>

<p>Figure 4 examines the relationship between income bracket and average SAT score. Clearly, we see a steady rise in SAT score as the income bracket increases, which does support our hypothesis that income is the best predictor of SAT score. Interestingly, the biggest gap in SAT scores seems to be in between the “income under 20k” and the “income between 20 and 40k” brackets, indicating that those in the lowest income bracket faces the most difficulty in doing well on the exam. This makes sense, as there have been many studies showing that the stress of living in poverty negatively affects how one’s brain functions.</p>

<div id="figure-4-inference" class="section level3">
<h3>Figure 4 Inference:</h3>
<p>To get an idea of how strong the relationship between income bracket and average SAT score is, we decided to summarize a linear model of the figure 4.</p>
<pre><code>##

## lm(formula = incomescore ~ income, data = lm2)

<p>We see here that there is a very strong positive correlation between income bracket and SAT score, as the R^2 value is very high and the absolute value of the t-stat for income is greater than 2.</p>
<p>Now that we have evidence suggesting that income bracket is a good predictor for SAT score, we decided to look at some other potential predictors.</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-5-sat-scores-by-gender-2005-2015" class="section level3">
<h3>Figure 5: SAT Scores by Gender, 2005-2015</h3>
<p>To look at whether or not there is a significant difference in SAT scores between genders, we took the yearly average SAT scores of males and females and plotted them.</p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/figure%205-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see here that throughout all 10 years of data in the dataset, there is a notable difference between genders for average SAT score. In order to look at this in more detail, we decided to create plots for the two sections of the SAT.</p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As we can clearly see, there is a much bigger difference between genders for the math section of the SAT compared to the verbal, and that the differences sometime differ in different years.</p>
<p>We wondered why this was the case and found a Forbes article (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2016/07/01/is-the-college-board-making-the-sat-more-difficult-for-women/?sh=19d2eb3a5f35" class="uri">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2016/07/01/is-the-college-board-making-the-sat-more-difficult-for-women/?sh=19d2eb3a5f35</a>) that explains a possible reason behind the gender difference in SAT scores: stereotype threat. Certain questions on the SAT, such as one asking test-takers to look at a graph showing more boys than girls in math classes, can wreak psychological havoc on female students’ minds during the exam, in turn worsening their performance. Until CollegeBoard takes significant action to overhaul the gender bias within their exams, it is possible that gender will be a good predictor of SAT scores.</p>

<p>Summarizing the linear regression model for gender and SAT score required a slightly different process than income brakcet, since gender is a categorical variable. To account for this, we created a dummy variable “female,” where “1” represents female and “0” represents male, then ran a linear regression on this variable and SAT score. We found that the gender dummy variable has a t-stat of -7.9, indicating that there is a statistically significant relationship between gender and SAT score.</p>

<p>Out of the 8 models produced, model 5 has the lowest Mallow’s CP value and thus would be the best model. In this one, the predictor variables are:
* income between 20-40k
* income between 80-100k
* female total score
* male total score
* year</p>
<p>Thus, income and gender are the best predictors for SAT score according to our dataset.</p>
