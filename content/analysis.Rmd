We describe here our detailed data analysis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(getwd())
data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/school_scores_data_clean.csv"))
load(here::here("dataset/school_scores.RData"))
print(ls())
```

-------
The variables we are most interested in are total math and verbal SAT scores as well as family income â€” namely, we want to examine whether or not there exists a statistically significant relationship between family income and SAT scores, and the form of these relationships (i.e., linear, logistic, etc.). Over the past several years, more and more questions have arose regarding whether or not colleges (and the rest of the world) should be looking at SAT scores as a credible measure of aptitude and intelligence, or if they are simply another tool for the privileged to remain at the top. 

Some questions we would like to answer are:

1. What is the nature of the relationship between family income and SAT scores?
2. Is this relationship statistically significant?
3. Are there differences in income and SAT scores between states? 
4. Is performance in certain subjects more sensitive to changes in family income than others (e.g., math vs. English)?
5. Is GPA more affected by family income than SAT scores?

* Modeling and Inference 
  * You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
  

```{r new data}
schooldata <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/school_scores_data_clean.csv"))
schooldatacleaned <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/schooldatacleaned.csv"))

schooldatacleaned <- schooldatacleaned %>% pivot_longer(c(income.less.than.20k, income.between.20.40k, income.between.60.80k, income.between.80.100k, income.more.than.100k), names_to = "income.bracket",values_to = "average.score.of.bracket", values_drop_na = TRUE) 

schooldatacleaned <- schooldatacleaned %>% select("state.code", "income.bracket", "total.score")
schooldatacleaned
```

```{r model 1}
sixstates <- c("MD", "NJ", "MA", "AR", "WV", "MS")
schooldata6 <- schooldata %>% filter(State.Code %in% sixstates) %>% mutate(Total.Score = Total.Math + Total.Verbal) %>% select("State.Code", "Total.Score") %>% group_by(State.Code) %>% transmute(avg.total.score = mean(Total.Score))
schooldata6

ggplot(data = schooldata6, mapping = aes(x = State.Code, y = avg.total.score, fill = State.Code)) + geom_col(aes(color = State.Code))
```

```{r model 2}
schooldatacleaned <- schooldatacleaned %>% select("income.bracket", "total.score") %>% group_by(income.bracket) %>% transmute(avg.total.score = mean(total.score))
schooldatacleaned

ggplot(schooldatacleaned) + geom_col(aes(x = income.bracket, y = avg.total.score, col = income.bracket))
```

  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? ...
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  
  
**NOTE**: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.
